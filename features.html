    <h3>CSS Variables 🎨</h3>
    <p>
      Think of variables as a way to store information that you want to reuse throughout your stylesheet. You can store things like colors, font stacks, or any CSS value you think you’ll want to reuse.

    <h3>Nesting 🪹</h3>
    <p>
      Rather than repeating the same selectors over and over again, you can write one style rule(s) inside another. Sass will automatically combine the outer rule’s selector with the inner rule’s.

    <h3>Modules 🔩</h3>
    <p>
      You don’t have to write all your Sass in a single file. You can split it up however you want with the @use rule. This rule loads another Sass file as a module, which means you can refer to its variables, mixins, and functions in your Sass file with a namespace based on the filename. Using a file will also include the CSS it generates in your compiled output!

    <h3>Mixins 🗂️</h3>
    <p>
      Mixins allow you to define styles that can be re-used throughout your stylesheet. They make it easy to avoid using non-semantic classes like .float-left, and to distribute collections of styles in libraries.
